## 🔭 Current Projects & Interests

[Forum-Dimensions official website](https://forumdimensions.org)
I developed this purely by myself. It is my greatest creation so far.

[Petsafe](https://github.com/Reiebenezer/petsafe-v2)
This is my only Java project. This was my submission for my group's final project in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

[NarsTrack](https://github.com/Reiebenezer/nars-track)
This is a native QR code reader application built as part of a commission. It's my first delve at [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/), a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-based cross-platform framework. 

[Project Revive](https://github.com/Reiebenezer/project-revive)
This is a prototype of the website I built for a commission. This is also one of the first projects I created with Svelte. 

[BullyChat](https://bully-chat.vercel.app/)
This is a one-day project for an assignment. It integrates Gemini as a 'bully' in the website using the Gemini API. 

> NOTE: There are more locally-based projects I was not able to include here, but I belive this should suffice.

## More About Me
- My biggest skill? I work really fast when motivated. I mean, I code very quickly with the right motivation. I learn fast too.
- I **HATE** vibe coding, but I use AI (only as a search engine and a code assistant).
